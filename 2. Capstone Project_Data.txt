We'd be analyzing the neighbourhood of NewYork and Manhattan for the accomodation project.

Neighborhood has a total of 5 boroughs and 306 neighborhoods. In order to segement the neighborhoods and explore them, we will essentially need a dataset that contains the 5 boroughs and the neighborhoods that exist in each borough as well as the the latitude and logitude coordinates of each neighborhood.

Luckily, this dataset exists for free on the web. Feel free to try to find this dataset on your own, but here is the link to the dataset: https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572

Steps performed to use the data set:
1.	Use geopy library to get the latitude and longitude values of New York City.
2.	Create a map of New York with neighborhoods superimposed on top.
3.	We can use Folium for visualization. But, for illustration purposes, let's simplify the above map and 	segment and cluster only the neighborhoods in Manhattan. So let's slice the original dataframe and create a 	new dataframe of the Manhattan data.
	And get the geographical coordinates of Manhattan.
4.	let's visualizat Manhattan the neighborhoods in it.
5. 	Explore Neighborhoods in Manhattan using Foursquare data
6.	Find out how many unique categories can be curated
7.	Group rows by neighborhood and by taking the mean of the frequency of occurrence of each category and print 	each neighborhood along with the top 5 most common venues
8.	Cluster the neighbors
9.	Examine the clusters
10.	Find the most suited place for the accomodation based on the analysis
